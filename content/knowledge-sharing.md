# Introduction to Static Site Generators: A Beginner’s Guide

Welcome to the world of Static Site Generators (SSGs)! If you’re looking to build a website and have heard about SSGs but aren’t quite sure what they are or how they work, you’ve come to the right place. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the basics of SSGs, why they’re useful, and how to get started with one.

## What is a Static Site Generator?

Imagine you want to build a house. You could either gather all the materials yourself and construct it brick by brick, or you could use pre-made components to speed up the process. A Static Site Generator is like the latter option for building websites. It automates the process of creating web pages by taking your content (like text and images) and combining it with templates to produce a fully-fledged website.

## Basic Concepts

Most websites today fall into two categories - dynamic sites and static sites:

- **Dynamic sites** are interactive, and the user experience can be tailored to the visitor. These are the ones that might remember who you are across visits or deliver content that's most applicable to the region you're visiting from. They rely on a content management system (CMS) or database for rendering and can continue to grow in complexity as the organization's needs grow. For example:
  - Facebook: A social networking site that generates personalized content for each user dynamically.
  - Amazon: An e-commerce site where product listings, recommendations, and checkout pages are dynamically generated based on user behavior and database queries.

- **Static sites**, however, generally display the same content to all users. They use server-side rendering to serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. They are fast and secure because there’s no database or server-side processing.

- **Generator**: A tool that takes your content (written in Markdown, HTML, etc.) and applies it to templates, generating the HTML files that make up your website.

## Why Use a Static Site Generator?

1. **Speed**

   Static sites are incredibly fast. Since the content is pre-generated and doesn’t rely on databases or server-side processing, pages load quickly, improving user experience and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

2. **Security**

   Static sites are less vulnerable to security threats because there’s no server-side processing or databases that can be exploited by hackers.

3. **Simplicity**

   Once set up, static site generators are easy to use. They automate the process of updating and publishing content, making it simple to manage even large sites.

4. **Flexibility**

   SSGs allow you to use modern development tools and practices. You can write your content in Markdown, use version control (like Git), and even integrate with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## How Does a Static Site Generator Work?

Let’s break down the process into simple steps:

1. **Write Content**: You write your content in a simple format, like Markdown or HTML. Think of this as writing articles or blog posts in a word processor.

2. **Choose a Template**: Templates define how your content will look on the website. You can think of templates as the blueprints for your website. Just like a house blueprint defines where the rooms go, templates define where the text, images, and other elements appear on the page.

3. **Generate the Site**: The SSG takes your content and templates and combines them to create a set of HTML files. These files are the finished product, like the completed house ready for you to move into.

4. **Deploy**: Finally, you upload the HTML files to a web server. Since the files are static, deployment is as simple as copying the files to the server.

## Popular Static Site Generators

Many static site generators are available for use today. Some important ones to know are:

- **Hugo**: Written in Go with support for multi-language sites and complex content strategy.
- **Jekyll**: Written in Ruby, built for blogging, and has a large collection of plugins and themes.
- **Hexo**: Node.js based with support for multiple templating engines, integrations with NPM packages, and one command deployment.
- **GatsbyJS**: React-based, works with any CMS, API, or database, and can be used for building headless experiences.
- **Astro**: JavaScript-based, supports multiple frameworks, and is known for on-demand rendering via partial hydration.

All static site generators can be exciting and fun, but some require time and effort on configurations, detailed templating, or management tweaks. My team and I joke that I am one of the top blog-less SSG experts, so in this blog post, I’ll walk you through a toolkit for evaluating your project and then share some SSGs that deploy to GitLab Pages.
